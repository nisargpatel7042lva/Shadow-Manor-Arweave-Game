Welcome to **Survive The Chase**, a thrilling survival game where your goal is simple – **run, dodge, and survive** for as long as you can while monsters chase you!

## 🚀 About the Project
This game was built by **me, Nisarg Patel, all alone in just 3 days!** As someone new to the world of gaming and Web3, I wanted to challenge myself by building a **fully on-chain survival game** for the **ADI Buildathon** to secure an entry into the **Hacker House**. 🏠💻
